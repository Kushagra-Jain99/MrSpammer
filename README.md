# MrSpammer
A python bot to spam any set of text on any desired platform

For creating this bot we will be using a package named as **pyautogui** which reaaly helpful for system controlling and a package known as **time** for performing sleep operations

Paste the mr-spammmer.py code in any file with **.py** extension and create a text file containing the spam message in the same directory.
You can use any spam message 

You can stop the message spamming by pressing 's' key on your keyboard for 1second

I personally used this message to spam https://web.njit.edu/~cm395/theBeeMovieScript/

After running the code, you will get 5 seconds to switch to any media like discord, whatsappwtc. and it will start spaming messages
